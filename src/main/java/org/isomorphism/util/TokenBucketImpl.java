/**
 * A token bucket implementation that is of a leaky bucket in the sense that it has a finite capacity and any added
 * tokens that would exceed this capacity will "overflow" out of the bucket and are lost forever.
 * <p/>
 * In this implementation the rules for refilling the bucket are encapsulated in a provided {@code RefillStrategy}
 * instance.  Prior to attempting to consume any tokens the refill strategy will be consulted to see how many tokens
 * should be added to the bucket.
 * <p/>
 * In addition in this implementation the method of yielding CPU control is encapsulated in the provided
 * {@code SleepStrategy} instance.  For high performance applications where tokens are being refilled incredibly quickly
 * and an accurate bucket implementation is required, it may be useful to never yield control of the CPU and to instead
 * busy wait.  This strategy allows the caller to make this decision for themselves instead of the library forcing a
 * decision.
